# Fact About Pokemons API

A simple API for getting pokemon data, using NestJS.

For dataset, [Competitive Pok√©mon Tier Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varlawend/competitive-pokmon-tier-dataset?resource=download) is used from kaggle.

## Setup

#### Requirements

In this project, [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) version 10.3.0 is used with TypeScript, any version above 10.0.0 should work fine.

For package management, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 10.4.0 is used.

#### Installation and Running

```bash
# installation
$ npm install

# development
$ npm run start

# unit tests
$ npm run test
```

There is almost none unit tests for now, hopefully will be added in the future.


## Services and Helpers

---

#### Abstract Class AppConfig

General-use static variables are defined here. Mostly for the dataset file paths.

---

#### Class PokemonService

For getting pokemon data from the dataset. Helper service for PokeController.

---

#### Class CsvService

Mostly used in PokemonService class. All properties and methods are static.

For reading csv files in the dataset. May not be the best way to do it, but still fine for manipulating csv files without holding the entire file in memory.

Static `separator` property is set to `,` for current database, for splitting any csv output from CsvService, this property should be used.

---

#### Class SearchService

Used in PokemonService.getSuggestions() method for creating a simple fuzzy search algorithm for pokemon names.

Uses a simple levenstein distance algorithm, with a threshold of 0.72.

Uses a simplification process to reduce characters with accents to their base characters in ASCII.

Also checks if the input word is a substring of any pokemon name.

---

#### Class ImageService

For getting pokemon images. Helper service for ImageController.

## API Documentation

Currently everything works locally, in 3000 port. We will get base url as `http://localhost:3000/` and call it 'BASE_URL' in this documentation.

There is **zero** authentication, CORS is enabled for all origins.

Enpoing structure:

```
BASE_URL
  /poke
    /valid/:name
    /random
    /:index
    /abilities/:name
    /ability/defs/:name
    /suggest/:input
    /moves/:name
    /move/defs/:name
    /stats/:name
    /types/:name
  /image
    /:name
```


There are 2 controllers, `/poke` and `/image`.
